# ReactGD GDX Language Prototype Pluginscript

This is a C++ implementation of the GDX Language prototype made in Javascript/Typescript for Godot using pluginscript.
I used the blog from this [github repository](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-lua-pluginscript), which is a pluginscript to use Lua programming language in Godot.
This blog explains pretty much everything needed to create a language based on pluginscripts (you don't need to recompile the entire engine to use) inside Godot.
